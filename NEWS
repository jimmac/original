Version 0.11.3
--------------

Work around a possible exec() exploit by removing functionality :) You cannot
use jhead or metacamfor exif anymore.

Version 0.11
------------

  Convert script
	--------------
	- New scripts from Boris de Laage <bdelaage@free.fr> with
	  more parameters, interactive mode, help and other goodies
	- iPhoto->Original script (Stephen Gerstacker)

	Web script
	----------
	- Localisation (partial fr and cs locales). Language taken from 
	  UA's accept language. Based on patch by some good soul I can't 
		seem to find the identity for.
	- Security and polishing (Lennart Poettering and Stephan Poehlsen).


Version 0.10
------------

  Convert script
	--------------
	
	- I added unsharp mask & saturation boost.
	- Thumbnails are stripped off EXIF tags. To do this for your existing
		thumbnails, run `mogrify -strip thumbs/*jpg`. You'll gain a lot of space if
		your exif header in the thumbnail includes a thumbnail (DOH). 
	- Added a world writable flag to comments dir, since it's required for the
		new feature - user comments.

	* convert/contrib: moved all the funky scripts there, please help
	me maintain them, patches very welcome.

	Web scripts
	-----------

		- Implemented user comments based on a patch by Christian
		  Troester. Had to add a simple form check since it was full of
		  spam the next day. Eek.

		- Added image access log (also needs comments dir writable)

		- Added some formatting to the PHP4 EXIF data

		- Cleaned up the default theme, now called dark. How original.
		  The Previous/Next thumbnails have access keys (Alt+P, Alt+N).
			The previews are top aligned so they don't jump depending on
			the height of the image. If you don't like any of these, feel
			free to use the old stylesheet. 
			
		- Moved the javascript to a separate file, wondered why IE
		  suddenly prefers not to render page, then used <script></script>
		  instead of <script />
			
		- Made it XHTML 1.0 Strict compilant, Didn't want to get rid of
			the -moz-* CSS extensions, but apart from that and the IE's
			Filter it's CSS2 compilant too. Classic and Gorilla don't use
			them and are compilant.

		- info.txt now accepts more date formats (You can even do
			foolish things like "Today")

	* info.txt.sample: Sample info.txt file to add metainfo to your
			album as described in the README.


version 0.9
-----------
* New default stylesheet. Is pwetty and doesn't crash IE, yay!
* Optional per-gallery meta information.  Finally you can now edit a fancy name
  (utf8), add a short description, specify author or override dir date.
	More on this in the README.
* Restricted Galleries (using info.txt). Note you need to make sure info.txt
	isn't readable (imgconv generated an appropriate .htaccess)
* Customizable sorting within month. $sortinmonth defines whether you want
	theitems sorted alphabetically or descending date.
