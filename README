This package includes two separate applications. In the www dir, there is the
PHP frontend app, the convert dir includes a simple (too simple i guess) script
that converts your wildcard of images into three subdirs in the current
directory. You can easily create and upload all images using:

   mkdir temp
   cd $_
   /path/to/imgconv *.png *.gif *.{jpeg,jpg}
   scp -rp ./web-gallery me@my_server:public_html/galleries/gallery_name

and that's it.

Tuomas Kuosmannen (tigert@tigert.com) has created a Nautilus script to create
"original" galleries (check the REQUIREMENTS file). Just copy the
convert/contrib/webgallery.pl file to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and make sure it's got
the execute bit set.

# UPDATE

   Apart from using netpbm package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/) for
   scaling images, the new webgallery-zenity.pl script uses Larry Ewing's
   gdk-pixbuf-based scaler. See REQUIREMENTS for details.

   Latest versions of the tools can be found at

Various Notes
=============

Gallery Dates
-------------
By default, original uses the directory timestamp to figure out the date of the
gallery. If I need to tweak it, i use `touch -d`. However some folks requested
a more convenient (is it?) way, using a "$gallery/date.txt" file. This
functionality has been replaced by the mew meta info file - info.txt:

  Info.txt format
	---------------

	The file is a simple text of "key|value" pairs on separate lines. The '|'
	separator is used, since you may want to use '=' and ':' as you're free to
	use html markup in the file. Make sure you use a utf8 capable editor.

	Some useful keys:
	-----------------

	date - can be used to override the timestamp of the directory
	name - you can override the dir name if you prefer not using utf8 filenames
	description - _short_ dexcription. Will be show in the index page.
	author - Useful if the photographer isn't you.
