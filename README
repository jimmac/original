This package includes two separate applications. In the www dir, there is the
PHP frontend app, the convert dir includes a simple (too simple i guess) script
that converts your wildcard of images into three subdirs in the current
directory. You can easily create and upload all images using:

   mkdir temp
   cd $_
   /path/to/imgconv *.png *.gif *.{jpeg,jpg}
   scp -rp ./web-gallery me@my_server:web_dir/gallery_name

and that's it.

Tuomas Kuosmannen (tigert@gimp.org) has created a Nautilus script to create
"original" galleries (check the REQUIREMENTS file). Just copy the
convert/webgallery.pl file to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and make sure it's got
the execute bit set.

# UPDATE

   Apart from using netpbm package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/netpbm/) for
   scaling images, the new webgallery-zenity.pl script uses Larry Ewing's
   gdk-pixbuf-based scaler. See REQUIREMENTS for details.
